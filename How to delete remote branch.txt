To delete a remote branch in Git, you can use the git push command with the --delete or -d option,
followed by the name of the remote branch you want to delete.

Here's the syntax for deleting a remote branch:
    git push <remote-name> --delete <branch-name>

In this command, <remote-name> is the name of the remote repository you want to delete the branch from (e.g. origin), 
and <branch-name> is the name of the branch you want to delete.

For example, if you want to delete the feature-branch remote branch from the origin remote repository, you can run the following command
    git push origin --delete feature-branch

Once you run this command, Git will delete the specified branch from the remote repository,
and it will no longer be visible in the list of remote branches when you run git branch -r.
Note that this command only deletes the remote branch and does not affect any local branches.
If you have a local branch that tracks the deleted remote branch,
you may want to delete it as well using the git branch -d command.
